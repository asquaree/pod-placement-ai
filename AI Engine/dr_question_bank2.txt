vDU POD Placement Common Rule

Q1: What determines how many vDU pods can be deployed on a server?  
A1: The pod must be deployed within the number of cores available on the server. Server core configurations can be 32pcore, 40pcore, 24pcore, or 32pcore x2socket, and 1 physical core equals 2 virtual cores.

Q2: How do I interpret "32pcore" vs "32pcore x2socket"?  
A2: "32pcore" means a single socket with 32 physical cores; "32pcore x2socket" means 2 sockets, each with 32 physical cores.

Q3: How many virtual cores (vcores) does a server with 24 physical cores have?  
A3: 24pcore means 48 vcores, since 1 physical core = 2 virtual cores.

Q4: Can a vDU be configured across multiple servers?  
A4: Yes, although it is configured on 1 server by default, it can be spread across multiple servers if needed.

Q5: How many vcores might CaaS require?  
A5: The number of cores needed for CaaS can be 2, 4, or 6 vcore, as determined by the business configuration.

Q6: What is the minimum requirement for shared core allocation?  
A6: At least 1 vcore must be allocated for shared core, though this can change depending on business needs.

Q7: How do you calculate the maximum allowed sum of pod core requests on a server?  
A7: (Sum of core requests from all pods on server) ≤ (Total server core count - CaaS core count - shared core count).

Q8: Where can I find details on pod types and their core requirements?  
A8: Refer to the “Flavor List SVRxxx” spreadsheet, ‘tab’, for information on POD types and vDU flavor core needs.

Q9: Which PODs are mandatory per vDU?  
A9: DPP, DIP, RMP, CMP, DMP, PMP must each be deployed once per vDU by default.


DPP Rule

Q10: How should DPP pods be placed by default?  
A10: One DPP pod must be placed per socket. As an exception, more than one per socket is allowed for vDU High Availability (HA).

Q11: What rule applies to DPP pods during in-service upgrade scenarios?  
A11: DPP pods must follow an anti-affinity rule—they should not be placed together on the same core or socket.


RMP Rule

Q12: How many RMP pods should be deployed compared to DPP pods?  
A12: Deploy the same number of RMP pods as DPP pods, on the same socket.

Q13: What is the rule for RMP pods if the vDU-RU connection is via a switch?  
A13: Use only one RMP pod per vDU (“cross vDU”) if the connection is through a switch.


CMP Rule

Q14: How should CMP pods be placed if High Availability is supported?  
A14: Place two CMP pods, with each following anti-affinity (not placed together).


VOS Operator Rule

Q15: What is the standard server and core setup for VOS Operator?  
A15: 32 physical cores (64vcores) or 40 physical cores (80vcores) per server, with CaaS assigned 4 vcores and shared core 2 vcores.

Q16: Is vCU deployment allowed?  
A16: Yes, if required.

Q17: How is the vCU flavor determined?  
A17:  
•  For vDU flavor ‘medium-regular-spr-t23’, use vCU ‘tiny-dran-mini’ (15 vcore).  
•  For all other vDU flavors, use ‘tiny-dran’ (18 vcore).

Q18: What is the rule for IPsec pods?  
A18:  
•  Always deploy IPP (IPsec POD).  
•  For multi-server vDU, deploy IIP on all servers that do NOT have an IPP.  
•  If DirectX2 is needed, place vDU (uADPF) IPP, vCU (ACPF) IPP, CSP, and vCU (AUPF) UPP on same server.

Q19: Which vDU flavors always deploy with IIP?  
A19: medium-tdd-spr-t20, small-tdd-spr-t20, and medium-tdd-gnr-t20 always include IIP.


VzW Rule

Q20: What are the core specifications for VzW servers?  
A20: 32 physical cores (64vcore) with 4 vcore reserved for CaaS.  
(Note: Rule update required.)


Boost Rule

Q21: How many servers and what core configurations are needed for Boost?  
A21: Two servers required, each with 24 physical cores (48vcore) or a 2-socket 32pcore system (64x2 vcores).

Q22: What are the CaaS core requirements for Boost?  
A22: 2, 4, or 6 vcores.

Q23: How are operations distributed in 2-socket servers?  
A23: Operations are performed per socket (NUMA unit).


Return/Validation Rule

Q24: What is reported if all rules pass validation?  
A24: Validation returns ‘Success’.

Q25: What happens if validation fails?  
A25: Validation returns ‘Failure’ with a detailed reason (e.g., ‘insufficient server core number’).


Additional Rules

Q26: How should DPP deployment in multi-server setups be handled for CaaS providers?  
A26: Refer to the Isol CPU value or DPP POD ID as per the provider’s requirements.

Q27: What are some example usages and values for shared core allocation?  
A27: For instance, PTP Notifi may use 0.3 vcore, and PaaS may use 0.8 vcore.
