Question 1:

Find the dimensioning flavor used by the VOS and list the pods and pod flavors used in the flavor one by one sequentially.

Find the dimensioning flavor used by the Verizon and mention the network function and list the pods and pod flavors used in the flavor one by one sequentially.

Find the dimensioning flavor used by the VOS and mention the network function and list the pods and pod flavors used in the flavor one by one sequentially.



Question 1:

You are a configuration analysis assistant.

Given a document or context related to telecom network functions and their configurations, extract the following information for VOS in the specified format exactly as shown below:

---
Dimensioning Flavor: <insert dimensioning flavor string>

Network Function: <insert network function name>

Pods and Pod Flavors:
1. <POD_TYPE_1>: <POD_FLAVOR_1>
2. <POD_TYPE_2>: <POD_FLAVOR_2>
3. ...
---

Only use the information present in the context. If something is missing, say "Not Available" in place of the value.

Now, based on the context below, extract and return the data:

{retrieved_context}


Question 2:

Let me know the resources used to write the corresponding pod flavors. Give information about all resources one by one sequentially for each pod flavor.

Question 3:

Task Type
Propose optimal pod placement for the given server based on the provided Flavor, ensuring compliance with rules.

Instructions
Before proceeding with pod placement, review and adhere to the common rules and operator-specific rules.
Ensure compliance with all rules while proposing pod placement that aligns with the server specifications and flavor specifications.
For calculations (arithmetic operations), start a new line with #Calculation, include the calculation formula, and provide the accurate result.
If the requested core count exceeds the available core count, inform the user that it is not possible with the current server configuration.

What to Do
Begin by summarizing the objective. List the server specifications and the Pod flavors that make up the given Flavor.
Explicitly state the Common Rules referred to.
Explicitly state the Operator-Specific Rules referred to.
Finally, propose the pod placement.
What Not to Do
Do not propose placements that violate the rules.
Do not make errors in arithmetic calculations—this is absolutely critical.
Do not address unrelated topics.
Example
For each Pod, list the requested core count and provide reasoning based on rules and Pod flavors. For example:

DPP Request: 24 vcore. Essential placement Pod; requires one per server as per medium-tdd-regular-spr Pod flavor.
IPP Request: 1 vcore. Required for IPsec support if demanded by VOS operator.
RMP Request: 4 vcore. Essential placement Pod; calculated based on medium-uni Pod flavor.
Shared Core: 2 vcore.
CaaS: 6 vcore.
vCU: 15 vcore. tiny-dran-mini flavor placement.
#Calculation 24 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 6 + 15 = 52 < 64
Placement is possible.

Let me know if the corresponding pod flavors can be successfully placed on the vcore server {num_server = 4 and number of vCores is 60}. Refer to the Pod placement rule, refer to which rule to specify in detail which pod is placed, and infer all processes as step-by-step.
